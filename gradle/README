## Generating Open Source Attributions for Projects using Gradle

For Gradle, the prefered way to produce notices is by using the CycloneDX Plugin to produce a BOM file with license attestation, to later parse and convert into a Legal Notices.

The configuration below must be added into the "app/build.gradle.kts" file to enable the plugin:

plugins {
    // Apply the application plugin to add support for building a CLI application in Java.
    application
	id("org.cyclonedx.bom") version "1.10.0"
}

Once the snippet has been added, we would need to run the target build and produce a BOM:

> gradle build
> gradle cyclonedxBom

Once the BOM is generated on "app/build/reports/bom.xml", the information can be parsed to produce a human readable document for Legal Notices using the sample script available <HERE>.
> python3 bom2notices.py
